Federation of Hong Kong Industries Committee Member � Lai Chi Kok, Hong Kong Committee Member Group 10 Group 10: Wood Products and Furniture, Fixtures and Interior Decorations, including Steel, Rattan and Wood Furniture The slow-pace recovery of the US and European economies, the weak consumption sentiment caused by the high unemployment rate in Europe and the appreciation of RMB undermined the performance of the manufacturing and export sectors in Hong Kong last year. Against all odds, the statistics of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council showed a satisfactory performance of Hong Kong&#039;s furniture export. Last year, the total value of export amounted to HK$2.7 billion and the export value of the first quarter this year has reached about HK$ 900 million. It reflected the strong competitive edge of the Hong Kong furniture industry in the global market. We expect a cautiously optimistic perspective of the furniture industry because of a better-than-expected employment rate released by the US recently and the positive outlook of the emerging markets like Central and South America, ASEAN, Russia and India. However, competition in the furniture industry remains rigorous. The strengthening US dollar and the continued appreciation of RMB have hindered the export industry. The market players, thus, should be cautious with cost controls and cash flows. Eco-friendly concept is the market trend of the furniture industry. Hong Kong furniture companies should seize the opportunity to capture the international market share by producing quality environmentally-friendly products. Meanwhile, we should not neglect the increasingly stringent rules and regulations imposed on environmental protection worldwide. On the other hand, the one billion �Dedicated Fund for Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales� (BUD Fund) launched by the HKSAR Government last year would help enhancing our competitiveness in the Mainland markets through developing brands, upgrading and restructuring the business operations. In the 2013 Policy Address, the Government pledged to facilitate the development of creative industries. It has also promised to inject an extra HK$300 million into the �CreatSmart Initiative� which will certainly promote the development of Hong Kong&#039;s furniture design industry. ?????????? - The Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business Vice-Chairman � Kowloon, Hong Kong ?? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?? ?? ?????????????????????????????????????? ?? ???????????????????? ????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ?? ??????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????100 ??????????????50 ????????????????????","male",,"","","","management",""

Each headdress is hand crafted using high quality silk flowers in vibrant colours and I try to reflect the 'language of flowers' in the creative process.

"ede5f44b7307ba89c79786cb09bc46a5",,"Civic Systems Lab 1 July 2014 to present � London, United Kingdom Seeding a local civic economy in the UK and around the world. We need to develop new open ways to produce a sustainable society, not just environmentally, but economically and socially as well. Poverty is always local and therefore asks for diverse responses. As local authorities, charities and social entrepreneurs are responding to fundamental welfare reform and growing needs, they increasingly find the current system is stretched to its limit. That means we need to develop wholly new ways to produce social outcomes � with a rich diversity in local responses mirrored by a radical re-making of our current systems. In order to alleviate &amp; systemically prevent poverty and its many side effects and we must create new conditions that re-enfranchise people to be active participants. A participatory and open society Many approaches to addressing poverty have been tried: redistribution, public service innovation, charity, social investment and area regeneration. Success has been varied � and all approaches come with their own limitations. Quite apart from whether we can afford them in the future, traditional approaches too often waste existing local resources and opportunities for resourcefulness. There is a growing alternative perspective: that in order to alleviate &amp; systemically prevent poverty we are going to need to create new conditions that move us collectively from a consumer modelled society to a participatory one. An open collective vision A collective vision of what is possible is already being pieced together. Over the last 5 years we have seen an explosion of new citizen-led and hybrid cross-sector experiments seeking to address our disenfranchised society. In food systems people are creating new ways to grow, sell, make, eat food - outside of existing consumer-orientated economic systems. We are seeing the system innovations in energy creation, distribution and surplus use, in monetary mechanisms through credit unions and local currencies, in the physical making of houses, furniture, clothing. These initiatives are working not to build new public services, remediation strategies or consumer markets but reframe our everyday local experience toward a participatory and civic economy. Each new initiative adds to a body of imaginative ideas and critical lessons of how we, as individuals and groups and organisations, can together create stronger local economies through an open and participatory society. We now need to go further�. with a whole systems approach Our challenge is now to create the conditions and mechanisms for such change to flourish � a whole systems approach which accelerates local initiatives to solve unique problems, with unique opportunities, using unique local resources. This practical and participatory localism cannot be, and must not be, a rare act performed by a few - but a common happening - a different way of living our day-to-day lives in which the many become co-producers of this new local. What this means in practice is changing complete sets of relationships, models, processes and methods, not just one or two. Change needs take place at every level - with citizens, government and organisations working together - from open policy to Collective Impact funds - through to the way we hold conversations, how we learn to make these changes together and understand its impact more rigorously. The Civic Systems Lab Mission Civic Systems Lab has built a body of knowledge on how we understand, seed, and develop citizen-led change and the civic economy. We have done this together with a wide range of partners from across the public private and third sector. Each of our partners and projects has helped us to better understand what�s possible and what�s at stake. We have researched local innovation extensively through Hand Made, the Community Lover�s Guides and the Compendium for the Civic Economy. We have a set of prototypes in progress that are testing the conditions, tactics, tools and wider platforms needed for supporting civic change, including The Open Works in Lambeth, Open Hub in Dudley, Hub Westminster in Westminster, The Common Room in Norwich, The Open Institute in London, Library Lab in Brent and Trading Spaces in Sidcup. Each of these prototypes re-designs infrastructures and methods to stimulate and support the emergence of new local initiative. And each of them creates a better understanding of the system in which they are currently embedded and how it needs to change, from project initiation to structural finance, from governance to collective learning. From March 2014 will be incubating civic initiatives across Birmingham and the Black Country with a �750,000 investment programme: with the Civic Systems Launchpad, part of the Hub Launchpad programme, we are increasing the scale to city level. We aim to scale up our impact by applying and validating what we have been learning into whole-systems re-design through collaborating with a further five major cities over the next 2 years. Together with our innovative partners and investors our mission is to transform society and accomplish tangible change for real people. http://www.civicsystemslab.org Future Shift Birmingham Lead � December 2013 to present Birmingham and the Black Country are full of people with ideas that are already transforming local places. Here and across the world new citizen-driven initiatives and ventures are making everyday life more exciting, participative and sustainable � from co-owned shops to local energy networks - from shared workspaces to urban farming and community harvesting.

Birmingham is brilliant, but it needs to be brilliant for everyone, lets create a space where global innovations have local impact and build a better, more just and equitable city, together. We believe this future cannot be delivered by start-ups alone, but by collaborations of passionate active thinkers, makers and doers working together to drive systemic change. From those changing our perceptions of art, literature, and business; to the creatives, intrapreneurs, startups, policy makers and politicians making it. Opening January 2015 in Digbeth, Birmingham.

Near Neighbours Catalyst Leadership Programme Birmingham Co - Lead � September 2012 to present � Birmingham, United Kingdom Co leading on the Birmingham Catalyst Leadership Programme, a 9 month programme for future leaders between the ages of 20 - 30 Vision The Catalyst vision is to contribute to the formation of a future leadership that prioritises civic engagement and builds association between different faiths and communities. It is designed as an integral part of the wider Near Neighbours Programme and as such its aims and objectives relate directly to Near Neighbours and its implementation is coordinated with other aspects of the Programme. Catalyst is undertaken through training and the establishment of networks and support that will utilise the best of interfaith principles and practice Aims build association and networking between young leaders of different faiths and ethnicities develop skills and confidence for young leaders to promote association in other settings increase religious and cultural literacy among young leaders who, having reflected on their self-identity are confident in their own identities and empowered in their civic engagement create safe spaces to talk about the difficult issues work for the long-term health and civic resilience of the city or town, and build civil society. support access to Near Neighbours Faith Partners delivering further new associations and local activities for the common good Objectives Catalyst will bring a group of young leaders from different faiths and communities together for shared learning and team building. They will not previously have had the experience of engaging across faith boundaries nor been given the chance for their leadership skills to be developed or exercised. They will be supported and trained to lead more effectively and to work across faith boundaries. Integral to Catalyst is the expectation that all participants will meet the challenge to design and run a Near Neighbours event or project in their local community. They will be supported to make the application for funds and offered extra skills training as needed. At the end of a 9 month period starting at recruitment, they will have achieved something together of benefit to themselves and their local community. They will report back on their achievements, both for their communities and for themselves. At a public event they will be recognised and thanked for their efforts and mandated to take forward their learning and community achievements for the common good of all. TEDx Curator of TEDxBrum Hub Launchpad Movement Builder � July 2013 to December 2013 � Birmingham, United Kingdom Welcome to the Open Venturing Movement We believe a new economy is in the making � one that is open-source, collaborative and socially driven. We see that this economy is going to be driven by inventors and intrapreneurs as well as start-ups. We know that the challenge is now to finance the coming together of ideas, talent and market access. HUB LAUNCHPAD is launching the Open Venture Movement to accelerate the Open Economy and grow the next generation of inventors, company founders, intrapreneurs and collaborators. It is an incubator programme focused on early-stage ideas and on the talent that could unlock these � focused on three of the biggest opportunities that the UK has to re-build its economy and society: public service innovation, finance innovation and digital &amp; micro manufacturing. We want to help catalyse and empower an Open Venture movement. Already, this movement has global pioneers and visionaries as well as local practitioners. Equally there are those for whom the Open concept will be entirely new. We want to work together right across this spectrum � to develop your idea, invest both in you and in your project and help you create a team and access the resources to make it happen. Our vision is to create a movement of open venturers. Through the four Hub Launchpad incubator programmes in London and Birmingham we aim to accelerate this new movement. Join us. This is an open call to join us in achieving our vision of an open innovation economy. If you are interested in inventing the Open Venture Movement whether in one of the Incubator programmes, the Faculty, our partnership or the core team � we�d love to hear from you and welcome you on this journey.

Faith is vitally important to hundreds of millions of people. It underpins systems of thought and of behaviour. It underpins many of the world&#039;s great movements for change or reform, including many charities. And the values of respect, justice and compassion that our great religions share have never been more relevant or important to bring people together to build a better world. But religious faith can also be used to divide. We have seen throughout history and today we still see how it can be distorted to fan the flames of hatred and extremism. Faiths Act is a global movement of people of different faiths in over 75 countries, taking action together against preventable disease and extreme poverty. Faiths Act Fellows in the UK, US and Canada are leading the campaign. Virgin Active Personal Trainer � June 2010 to December 2010 � Solihull Impact Hub","female",,"","","","management",""

Qubit Customer Solutions Engineer � 12 August 2013 to 24 January 2014 � London, United Kingdom Microsoft Development Support Engineer � 4 July 2011 to 29 June 2012 � Reading, England A yearlong internship with the Global Technical Support Center working directly with Microsoft�s customers and partners to resolve any development or deployment issues they had whilst using the company�s products. The role is best described as a mix of development, support and consultancy, and required the flexibility to work across the three disciplines depending on the situation. I worked in the team covering Internet Information Services (v6.0+), ASP, ASP.NET, Silverlight and Internet Explorer and related technologies for EMEA, and had to be adaptable to work at a deep technical level with customers of varying languages and cultures. The vast majority of my time was direct customer contact, resolving complex technical issues, often of a mission critical nature and highly political within the organization. I had to be able to switch context quickly between customers as more information came in, and then performing analysis in order to come to a resolution. This often involved going as far as debugging from memory dumps in WinDBG and working with source code and symbols. My communication skills and time management were key here in order to interpret what the issue was based on a sometimes simple descriptions, breaking it down into manageable tasks, working with the customer to gather the data I needed, and then after performing analysis, communicate effectively the resolution, usually in a time constrained, and sometimes high stress critical situations.
