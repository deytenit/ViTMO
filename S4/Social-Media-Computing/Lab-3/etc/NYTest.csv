It is a canvas upon which we paint with our camera. Subtle nuance, candid looks, raw emotion. All there to see and feel.� As wedding and engagement photographers, we constantly look for more than what meets the eye. Some things are obvious. Some not. It�s a matter of listening, paying attention to detail, body language and even tone of voice. Every image we captture is the result of all of these elements. We take the approach of an active observer. Allow the day to unfold as it will and guide you as needed. Portraits, bridal and family, are done in a personable, yet efficient manner. Breathe, be yourself, be in the moment. Natural, organic imagery. Our style is continuously evolving with each wedding and engagement we photograph, but our attitude has remained pretty much the same as when we started. Create a relaxed environment, pay attention to detail and listen. Three simple rules of thumb that work rather well for us. At locations we photograph often, we constantly seek out different perspectives and new angles to keep it fresh. If a new venue is new to us, we find the areas we like best and look forward to an exciting session! Photographing somewhere for the first time holds a certain, unfiltered magic that is often some our best work. Every wedding is a wonderful opportunity to travel down a new road with a bride &amp; groom on one of the most important days of their lives and we look forward to photographing the start of your exciting journey together.
