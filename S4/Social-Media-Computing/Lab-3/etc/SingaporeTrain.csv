Photographers across social media platforms, blogs and websites have provided a myriad of photography tutorials and challenges. The problem is locating them all can be a hassle and a waste of your time. F Stop Lounge was created by photographers for photographers. The photographers behind the site come from all over the world, places like Australia, Canada, England, Germany and the USA. Google+ was our meeting place where over months we developed strong social bonds centred around photography. With decades of experience in the photographic arena the founding photographers decided to create a website which would help others learn about photography. Across F Stop Lounge you will find inspirational photographs, informative tutorials, helpful hints and tips all about photography. We encourage visitors to comment and interact with us � either on the site or across various social media networks.
